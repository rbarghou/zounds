Like... don't even read it.

Yeah, I mean it.

This repo is off limits!  It's mine!  All mine!

...

Just checking in.  No one's been reading this code, right?  I don't want anyone
to read it at all!  It's only for me.

If you want to even read this licence, you can't!

Not without written permission.

And digital copies don't count.  Not even typed copies.

It must be hand written and sealed with my wax seal... Yeah!

Open source?  Open whatever...
